Show What You Know: Applied AI System
ℹ️ Project Overview

⏰ ~4 hours

This final project is your opportunity to bring everything together, from debugging and design (Module 1-2) to reasoning and retrieval (Module 3-4), and finally agentic workflows and reliability testing (Module 5).

You'll choose one of your previous projects from Modules 1-3 and extend it into a full applied AI system that solves a meaningful problem or automates a reasoning task. This is your chance to evolve an earlier prototype into a polished, professional artifact.

Your system should demonstrate responsible design, technical creativity, and clear explanation of how the AI works and why it's trustworthy.

🎯 Goals

By completing this project, you will be able to...

    Extend and redesign a prior mini-project into a cohesive, end-to-end AI integrated system.
    Implement modular components (retrieval, logic, or agentic planning) using Python.
    Test and evaluate system reliability and guardrails through structured experiments.
    Document and explain the AI's decision-making process clearly and responsibly.
    Communicate results through a professional presentation and portfolio entry.

📊 Before you start, review the Grading Rubric to understand exactly how your project will be evaluated, including required features and optional stretch challenges worth extra points.

⚙️ Project Requirements

0. Preparing Your Project Environment

Because this project is an evolution of your earlier work, you should create a dedicated copy of your chosen repo. This allows you to experiment freely without altering your original Module 1-3 submission.

    Go to GitHub and create a new, public repo.
        Name it something professional, like applied-ai-system-project.
        Do not initialize it with a README, license, or .gitignore. Keep it completely empty.
        Copy the URL of this new repo (e.g., https://github.com/username/applied-ai-system-final.git)
    Open your terminal or command prompt. You'll now download a "bare" version of your original repo -- this contains all the code and the full history but no working files.
        Run this command: git clone --bare https://github.com/username/your-original-repo.git
        Enter the folder created: cd your-original-repo.git
    Now you'll take all that history and code and "mirror" it into the new repo you created. Push the data to your new repo by running this command (replace the URL with your new one): git push --mirror https://github.com/username/applied-ai-system-final.git
    Now that your data is in the new repo, you can delete the temporary "bare" folder and clone your new project to start working.
        Go back one folder: cd ..
        Delete the bare folder: rm -rf your-original-repo.git
        Clone your new final project repo: git clone https://github.com/username/applied-ai-system-final.git
        Enter your project folder: cd applied-ai-system-final

Before you begin coding, set up a professional folder structure in your new repo.

    Create a folder in your project called assets. This will be your dedicated directory for your system architecture images and screenshots.
    If you are using Mermaid.js for your diagrams, be aware that free accounts are often limited to three charts. To avoid this limit, use the Mermaid Live Editor to build your diagram, then export it as a PNG and save it into your /assets folder.

1. Functionality: What Your System Should Do

Your project should do something useful with AI. For example:

    Summarize text or documents
    Retrieve information or data from a source
    Plan and complete a step-by-step task
    Help debug, classify, or explain something

To make your project more advanced, it must include at least one of the following AI features:
Feature 	What It Means 	Example
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 	Your AI looks up or retrieves information before answering. 	A study bot that searches notes before generating a quiz question.
Agentic Workflow 	Your AI can plan, act, and check its own work. 	A coding assistant that writes, tests, and then fixes code automatically.
Fine-Tuned or Specialized Model 	You use a model that’s been trained or adjusted for a specific task. 	A chatbot tuned to respond in a company’s tone of voice.
Reliability or Testing System 	You include ways to measure or test how well your AI performs. 	A script that checks if your AI gives consistent answers.

The feature should be fully integrated into the main application logic. It is not enough to have standalone script; the feature must meaningfully change how the system behaves or processes information. For example, if you add RAG, your AI should actively use the retrieved data to formulate its response rather than just printing the data alongside a standard answer.

Also, make sure your project:

    Runs correctly and reproducibly: If someone follows your instructions, it should work.
    Includes logging or guardrails: Your code should track what it does and handle errors safely.
    Has clear setup steps: Someone else should be able to run it without guessing what to install.

2. Design and Architecture: How Your System Fits Together

Show how your project is organized by creating a short system diagram. Your diagram should include:

    The main components (like retriever, agent, evaluator, or tester).
    How data flows through the system (input → process → output).
    Where humans or testing are involved in checking AI results.

3. Documentation: How You Explain Your Work

You'll write a README file that clearly explains your project. It should include:

    Explicitly name your original project (from Modules 1-3) and provide a 2-3 sentence summary of its original goals and capabilities.
    Title and Summary: What your project does and why it matters.
    Architecture Overview: A short explanation of your system diagram.
    Setup Instructions: Step-by-step directions to run your code.
    Sample Interactions: Include at least 2-3 examples of inputs and the resulting AI outputs to demonstrate the system is functional.
    Design Decisions: Why you built it this way, and what trade-offs you made.
    Testing Summary: What worked, what didn't, and what you learned.
    Reflection: What this project taught you about AI and problem-solving.

Write this for a future employer who might look at your GitHub portfolio! Clarity and completeness matter more than perfection.

4. Reliability and Evaluation: How You Test and Improve Your AI

Your AI should prove that it works, not just seem like it does. Include at least one way to test or measure its reliability, such as:

    Automated tests (e.g., unit tests or simple checks for key functions).
    Confidence scoring (the AI rates how sure it is).
    Logging and error handling (your code records what failed and why).
    Human evaluation (you or a peer review the AI's output).

Summarize your testing in a few lines, like:

    5 out of 6 tests passed; the AI struggled when context was missing. Confidence scores averaged 0.8; accuracy improved after adding validation rules.

5. Reflection and Ethics: Thinking Critically About Your AI

AI isn't just about what works -- it's about what's responsible. Include a short reflection answering the following questions:

    What are the limitations or biases in your system?
    Could your AI be misused, and how would you prevent that?
    What surprised you while testing your AI's reliability?
    describe your collaboration with AI during this project. Identify one instance when the AI gave a helpful suggestion and one instance where its suggestion was flawed or incorrect.

🚀 Optional: Stretch Features for Extra Points

These features are completely optional and go beyond the required 21 points. Completing them can earn up to +8 additional points, allowing your score to exceed 100%. See the Grading Rubric for how each is evaluated.
Feature 	What To Build 	Points
RAG Enhancement 	Extend your retrieval system to use custom documents or multiple data sources. Show how it measurably improves your AI's output quality. 	+2
Agentic Workflow Enhancement 	Implement multi-step reasoning with observable intermediate steps — tool-calls, planning steps, or a decision-making chain. 	+2
Fine-Tuning or Specialization 	Demonstrate specialized model behavior using few-shot patterns, synthetic datasets, or constrained tone/style. Show that output measurably differs from the baseline. 	+2
Test Harness or Evaluation Script 	Build a script that runs your system on a set of predefined inputs and prints a summary (pass/fail scores, confidence ratings, or similar). 	+2
Note: These stretch features build directly on the required AI feature you chose in Step 1. For example, if you added RAG as your required feature, the RAG Enhancement stretch would extend that same component further.
